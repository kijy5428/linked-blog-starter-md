Excellent follow-up! You're absolutely right to ask about `HttpClientFactory`, because it's often the **preferred** approach in modern ASP.NET Core applications.

### üß∞ Why Use `IHttpClientFactory` Instead of `AddSingleton<HttpClient>`?

`IHttpClientFactory` was introduced to solve several issues that arise when using `HttpClient` as a singleton.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits of `IHttpClientFactory`:

1. **Avoids Socket Exhaustion**\ When `HttpClient` is used incorrectly (e.g., created per request or reused improperly), it can lead to **socket exhaustion** due to improper connection reuse. `IHttpClientFactory` manages the lifetime of `HttpMessageHandler` under the hood to prevent this.
    
2. **Centralized Configuration**\ You can configure named or typed clients with default headers, base addresses, policies (like retries, timeouts), etc.
    
3. **Integration with Polly**\ It supports **resilience policies** like retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts using Polly.
    
4. **Logging and Diagnostics**\ It provides better logging, tracing, and diagnostics support out of the box.

### üîÅ When to Use `AddSingleton<HttpClient>`?

Using `AddSingleton` directly is okay **only if**:

- You **fully control** the lifecycle and configuration.
- You **don‚Äôt need** advanced features like retries, logging, or per-client customization.
- You‚Äôre building a **simple app or tool** with minimal HTTP needs.

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Using `IHttpClientFactory`

Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd use it:

```CSharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("WeatherClient", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.weather.gov");
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent.Add(new ProductInfoHeaderValue("weather-tool", "1.0"));
});
```

Then inject it like this:

```CSharp
public class WeatherService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _client;

    public WeatherService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
    {
        _client = httpClientFactory.CreateClient("WeatherClient");
    }

    // Use _client to make requests...
}
```
