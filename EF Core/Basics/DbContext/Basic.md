### ðŸ§  **What is `DbContext` in EF Core?**

The `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core represents a **session with the database** and serves as the **main API** for interacting with data. It handles everything from querying and saving data to managing connections and tracking changes.

### ðŸ”‘ **Core Responsibilities of `DbContext`**

|**Feature**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Database Connections**|Opens and manages connections to the database.|
|**Data Operations**|Supports adding, modifying, deleting, and querying data via `DbSet`.|
|**Change Tracking**|Tracks changes to entities and determines what SQL operations to perform.|
|**Model Building**|Builds a conceptual model from configuration and conventions at startup.|
|**Data Mapping**|Maps SQL query results to entity instances.|
|**Object Caching**|Provides a first-level cache to avoid redundant database queries.|
|**Transaction Management**|Wraps `SaveChanges()` in a transaction to ensure atomic updates.|

### âœ… Highlights

- `DbContext` uses a **Change Tracker** to monitor entity states (`Added`, `Modified`, `Deleted`, etc.).
- It builds and stores the **data model** in memory for the lifetime of the application.
- It ensures **transactional integrity** when saving changes â€” rolling back if errors occur.
