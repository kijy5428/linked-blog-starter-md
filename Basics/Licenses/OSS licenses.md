- An Open source project should always declare it's license in the repo (otherwise no one can make sure whether it can really be further revised / republished ...)

Absolutely! Let’s dive deeper into the **different types of Open Source Software (OSS) licenses**, with **detailed explanations and real-world examples** to help you understand how they work and when to use them.

---

## 🧩 1. **Permissive Licenses**

These are the most flexible. They allow you to use, modify, and even relicense the software under proprietary terms.

### 🔹 **MIT License**

- **What it allows**: Do almost anything—use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell.
- **Requirements**: Must include the original license and copyright.
- **Use case**: Great for startups and commercial products.
- **Example**:  
    - React (by Meta)
    - jQuery

---

### 🔹 **Apache License 2.0**

- **What it allows**: Similar to MIT, but also includes **explicit patent rights**.
- **Requirements**: Must include license, NOTICE file, and state changes.
- **Use case**: Ideal for companies concerned about patent litigation.
- **Example**:  
    - TensorFlow (by Google)
    - Apache Kafka

---

### 🔹 **BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)**

- **What it allows**: Very similar to MIT.
- **Requirements**: Include license; 3-Clause version adds a “no endorsement” clause.
- **Use case**: Academic and enterprise-friendly.
- **Example**:  
    - FreeBSD
    - PostgreSQL

## 🧩 2. **Copyleft Licenses**

These require that **derivative works also be open source** under the same license.

### 🔸 **GNU General Public License (GPL) v2/v3**

- **What it allows**: Use, modify, distribute.
- **Requirements**: Must release source code of derivative works under GPL.
- **GPLv3 adds**: Anti-Tivoization, patent protection.
- **Use case**: Projects that want to ensure all derivatives remain open.
- **Example**:  
    - Linux Kernel (GPLv2)
    - GNU Bash (GPLv3)

---

### 🔸 **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)**

- **What it allows**: Use in proprietary software via dynamic linking.
- **Requirements**: Modifications to LGPL components must be open.
- **Use case**: Libraries that want to be used in both open and closed software.
- **Example**:  
    - FFmpeg
    - Glibc

---

### 🔸 **Mozilla Public License (MPL)**

- **What it allows**: Use, modify, distribute.
- **Requirements**: Only modified files must be open-sourced.
- **Use case**: Balanced approach between permissive and copyleft.
- **Example**:  
    - Firefox
    - Bugzilla

---

## 🧩 3. **Creative Commons (CC) Licenses**

- **Not for software**: Used for content like documentation, images, videos.
- **Variants**: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, etc.
- **Example**:  
    - Wikipedia (CC-BY-SA)
