### How RAG works

Great question! **RAG**, or **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, is a technique used in AI systems (especially language models) to improve their responses by retrieving relevant information from external sources—like documents, databases, or search engines—before generating an answer.

### What does RAG do?

RAG combines two components:

1. **Retriever**: This part searches a knowledge base (like a document store or vector database) to find relevant chunks of information based on the user's query.
2. **Generator**: This part (usually a language model) uses the retrieved information to generate a more accurate and context-aware response.

So instead of relying only on what the model was trained on, RAG allows it to "look up" fresh or domain-specific information.

### Does RAG use the whole document of a searched chunk?

Not exactly. Here's how it typically works:

- Documents are **split into smaller chunks** (e.g., paragraphs or sections).
- When a query is made, the retriever **searches for the most relevant chunks**, not entire documents.
- The generator then uses **only those top-ranked chunks** (often just a few) to produce the final response.

This makes the process more efficient and focused, avoiding irrelevant or overly broad content.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you're asking a chatbot about a specific legal clause. Instead of guessing, the RAG system retrieves the exact paragraph from a legal document and uses it to answer your question accurately.
