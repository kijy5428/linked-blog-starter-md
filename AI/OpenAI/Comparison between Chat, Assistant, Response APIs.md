### Chat Completions

The Chat Completions API remains our most widely used API. We'll continue supporting it with new models and capabilities**. If you don't need built-in tools for your application**, you can confidently continue using Chat Completions.

We'll keep releasing new models to Chat Completions whenever their capabilities don't depend on built-in tools or multiple model calls. When you're ready for advanced capabilities designed specifically for agent workflows, we recommend the Responses API.

## Assistants

Based on developer feedback from the [Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants) beta, we've incorporated key improvements into the Responses API to make it more flexible, faster, and easier to use. The Responses API represents the future direction for building agents on OpenAI.

We're working to achieve full feature parity between the Assistants and the Responses API, including support for Assistant-like and Thread-like objects and the Code Interpreter tool. When complete, we plan to formally announce the deprecation of the Assistants API with a target sunset date in the first half of 2026.

Upon deprecation, we will provide a clear migration guide from the Assistants API to the Responses API that allows developers to preserve all their data and migrate their applications. Until we formally announce the deprecation, we'll continue delivering new models to the Assistants API.
