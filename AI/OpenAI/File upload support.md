# File inputs

Learn how to use PDF files as inputs to the OpenAI API.

OpenAI models with vision capabilities can also accept PDF files as input. Provide PDFs either as Base64-encoded data or as file IDs obtained after uploading files to the `/v1/files` endpoint through the [API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) or [dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/storage/files/).

## How it works

To help models understand PDF content, we put into the model's context both the extracted text and an image of each page. The model can then use both the text and the images to generate a response. This is useful, for example, if diagrams contain key information that isn't in the text.

## File URLs

Inputs by file URL are not supported for chat completions. Use the [ResponsesAPI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/pdf-files?api-mode=responses#file-urls) for this option.

## Uploading files

In the example below, we first upload a PDF using the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files), then reference its file ID in an API request to the model.

Upload a file to use in a completion

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -F purpose="user_data" \
    -F file="@draconomicon.pdf"

curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "file",
                        "file": {
                            "file_id": "file-6F2ksmvXxt4VdoqmHRw6kL"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

## Base64-encoded files

You can also send PDF file inputs as Base64-encoded inputs.

Base64 encode a file to use in a completion

```bash
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-5",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "file",
                        "file": {
                            "filename": "draconomicon.pdf",
                            "file_data": "...base64 encoded bytes here..."
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": "What is the first dragon in the book?"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }'
```

## Usage considerations

Below are a few considerations to keep in mind while using PDF inputs.

**Token usage**

To help models understand PDF content, we put into the model's context both extracted text and an image of each page—regardless of whether the page includes images. Before deploying your solution at scale, ensure you understand the pricing and token usage implications of using PDFs as input. [More on pricing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

**File size limitations**

You can upload multiple files, each less than 10 MB. The total content limit across all files in a single API request is 32 MB.

**Supported models**

Only models that support both text and image inputs, such as gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, or o1, can accept PDF files as input. [Check model features here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

**File upload purpose**

You can upload these files to the Files API with any [purpose](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create#files-create-purpose), but we recommend using the `user_data` purpose for files you plan to use as model inputs.
