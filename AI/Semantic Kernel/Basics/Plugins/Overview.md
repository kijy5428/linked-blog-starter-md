Here’s a detailed and structured summary of the Microsoft Learn page on **Semantic Kernel Plugins** (C#), ideal for note-taking:

---

## 🧩 What Are Plugins in Semantic Kernel?

- **Plugins** encapsulate your existing APIs or native code into callable functions for AI.
- They enable AI to perform actions it couldn’t otherwise, such as interacting with databases, services, or devices.
- Built on **function calling**, a native LLM feature that allows the AI to request specific functions.
- Semantic Kernel handles the function call, executes the code, and returns the result to the LLM.

---

## 🧠 Why Plugins Matter

- Unlike other SDKs that only support “functions” or “tools,” Semantic Kernel plugins:
    - Mirror enterprise development patterns (e.g., services, APIs).
    - Support **Dependency Injection** (DI) for injecting services like DBs, HTTP clients, etc.
    - Are modular and reusable across applications.

---

## 🔍 Anatomy of a Plugin

- A plugin is a **group of functions** exposed to the AI.
- Functions must include:
    - `[KernelFunction]` attribute
    - `[Description]` for function and parameters
    - `[JsonPropertyName]` for parameter naming
- Semantic descriptions help the AI understand what the function does and how to use it.

---

## 🔌 Types of Plugins

### 1. **Native Code Plugins**

- Written in C# with annotations.
- Best for leveraging existing code and services.
- Supports DI.

### 2. **OpenAPI Plugins**

- Imported from OpenAPI specs.
- Enables cross-platform plugin sharing.

### 3. **MCP Server Plugins**

- Imported from a Microsoft Copilot Plugin server.
- Useful for centralized, service-based plugin access.

---

## 🧪 Types of Plugin Functions

- **Retrieval Functions**: Used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
    - May benefit from caching or summarization.
- **Task Automation Functions**: Perform actions.
    - Often require human-in-the-loop approval.

## 🛠 Using Plugins in 3 Steps

### 1. **Define the Plugin**

- Create a class with annotated methods.
- Use snake_case for function and property names (LLMs are trained on Python-style naming).

### 2. **Add the Plugin to the Kernel**

```CSharp
builder.Plugins.AddFromType<LightsPlugin>("Lights");
Kernel kernel = builder.Build();
```

### 3. **Invoke Plugin Functions**

- Use function calling via chat completion.
- Let the AI decide which functions to call based on user input.

---

## 🧠 Example: LightsPlugin

- Functions: `get_lights`, `get_state`, `change_state`
- Uses `[KernelFunction]`, `[Description]`, and `[JsonPropertyName]`
- Demonstrates how AI can reason through function calls to fulfill a user request like “turn on the lamp.”

## ✅ Best Practices for Authoring Plugins

### 🔹 Import Only What You Need

- Reduces token usage and improves accuracy.
- OpenAI recommends ≤10 tools per call.

### 🔹 Make Plugins AI-Friendly

- Use clear, descriptive names.
- Avoid abbreviations.
- Keep parameter lists short and use primitive types.
- Use `[Description]` only when necessary to save tokens.

### 🔹 Balance Function Granularity

- Too many small functions = more token and network overhead.
- Too few large functions = harder for AI to reason about parameters.
- Find a balance between reusability and efficiency.

## 🔄 Transforming Functions

Use transformation techniques to:

- Wrap or modify existing functions.
- Inject context (e.g., user ID, auth tokens).
- Simplify complex signatures for AI compatibility.

---

## 🔐 Local State Usage

- For large or sensitive data, store it locally and pass a `state_id` instead.
- Keeps data private and reduces token usage.

---

## 📦 Provide Return Type Schemas

- Helps the AI understand expected outputs.
- Reduces ambiguity and improves accuracy of function calls.
