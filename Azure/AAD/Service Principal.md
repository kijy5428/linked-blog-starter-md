	- most of the time, App reisgrtaion would be created together with service principal
- Service principal can also be added as group member
- We can also login as service principal

- The moment you create an app reisgristration and grant permission => service principal got created 
- ServicePrincipal => can has not related apps
- Apps => would always binds to service principal
	- ex: Creation of the app sahilapp => create a managed identity (service principal with the same name)
