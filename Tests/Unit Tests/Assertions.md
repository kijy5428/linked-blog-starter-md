### ✅ **Understanding Asserts in Unit Testing (with xUnit)**

#### 🔹 **What is an Assert?**

- An **assert** is a **Boolean expression** that should evaluate to **true**.
- If it evaluates to **false**, the **assert fails**, and so does the test.
- Tests can contain **one or more asserts**:
    - **Pass**: All asserts are true.
    - **Fail**: One or more asserts are false.

---

### 🔹 **xUnit and Assert Capabilities**

xUnit provides assert functionality for a wide range of testing scenarios, including:

- ✅ **Booleans**
- ✅ **Strings**
- ✅ **Numeric values** (including floating points)
- ✅ **Collections**
- ✅ **Events**
- ✅ **Exceptions**
- ✅ **Types**

A good unit testing framework like xUnit supports all these and more.

### 🔹 **How Many Asserts Should a Test Have?**

|Approach|Description|
|---|---|
|**Strict**|One assert per test to clearly identify the cause of failure.|
|**Practical**|Multiple asserts are acceptable **if they test the same behavior**.|

#### ✅ **Example: Salary Range Validation**

- **Behavior to test**: Salary must be between **2500 and 3500**.
- **Option 1**: Two separate tests:
    - Assert salary ≥ 2500
    - Assert salary ≤ 3500
- **Better Option**: One test with **two asserts** for the same behavior.
- **Best Option**: One assert checking if salary is **within the range**.

> 🔸 **Key Point**: It’s not about the number of asserts, but about **testing one unit of behavior** per test.

---

### 🔹 **What to Avoid**

- Don’t test **multiple unrelated behaviors** in the same test.
    - ❌ Example: Testing salary range **and** bonus calculation in one test.
    - ✅ Instead: Create **separate tests** for each behavior.

---

### 🧠 **Takeaway**

> **Think in terms of behavior units** when designing your tests.  
> Use as many asserts as needed **to fully verify one behavior**, but avoid mixing different behaviors in a single test.
