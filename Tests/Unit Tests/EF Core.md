# ðŸ§ª EF Core & Test Isolation â€“ Summary Notes

---

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose of Test Isolation in EF Core

- EF Core is typically used for **database I/O operations**.
- For **unit testing**, we want to **avoid real I/O** (e.g., reading from disk).
- Goal: Use **in-memory alternatives** to isolate tests from external systems.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Avoid File-Based SQLite in Tests?

- SQLite in demo reads from a **file on disk** â†’ introduces I/O.
- This breaks **test isolation** and slows down tests.

## ðŸ”¹ EF Core In-Memory Testing Options

|**Option**|**Description**|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**In-Memory Provider**|EF Core provider that stores data in memory.|- Fast  <br>- Easy to set up  <br>- No I/O|- Not a real RDBMS  <br>- No support for transactions or raw SQL  <br>- Behaves differently from real DB|
|**SQLite (In-Memory Mode)**|SQLite configured to run entirely in memory.|- Real relational DB  <br>- Better compatibility with production DBs|- Slight differences if production DB is not SQLite|

> âœ… **Microsoft discourages** using the in-memory provider for anything beyond **simple unit tests**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ When to Use Each

- **Use In-Memory Provider**:
    
    - For **simple unit tests**.
    - When you donâ€™t need to test SQL, transactions, or DB-specific behavior.
- **Use SQLite In-Memory**:
    
    - For **more realistic behavior**.
    - When you want **closer compatibility** with production relational DBs.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- EF Core supports **test isolation** via in-memory options.
- Avoid real database I/O in unit tests.
- Choose the provider based on **test complexity** and **realism needs**.
- SQLite in-memory is generally the **preferred option** for realistic testing.
