|**Test Isolation**|✅ Strong focus|⚠️ Moderate|⚠️ Moderate|
|**Extensibility**|✅ High|⚠️ Limited|✅ High|

### **Summary**

- **xUnit** is the modern, lightweight, and preferred framework for .NET Core development.
- **MSTest** is Microsoft's legacy framework, now open source but still carries older design patterns.
- **NUnit** is powerful and flexible but has legacy baggage due to its long history.
