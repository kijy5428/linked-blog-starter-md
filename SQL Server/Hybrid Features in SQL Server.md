### üåê Hybrid Features in SQL Server 2022

SQL Server 2022 introduces several **cloud-integrated (hybrid)** features to help organizations bridge on-premises infrastructure with Azure services.

---

#### 1. **Azure Arc-Enabled SQL Server**

- Links **on-prem SQL Server metadata** to Azure.
- Enables centralized management across environments.
- Key benefits:
    - **Metrics & logs reporting** to Azure
    - **Best practice assessments**
    - **Centralized update management**
    - **Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication** (SQL Server 2022 only)
- Arc-enablement is available from **SQL Server 2012** onward (with limited features).

---

#### 2. **Azure Synapse Link for SQL Server**

- Enables **near real-time replication** of OLTP tables to **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
- Uses:
    - **Self-hosted integration runtime**
    - **Azure Data Lake Storage**
    - **Dedicated SQL pool in Synapse**
- Allows selection of tables to replicate.
- Comes with **some limitations** (e.g., supported table types, performance constraints).

---

#### 3. **SQL Managed Instance Link**

- Connects **on-prem SQL Server** with **Azure SQL Managed Instance**.
- Use case:
    - On-prem SQL Server is primary.
    - Azure Managed Instance acts as **hot standby**.
    - Supports **automated failover** during outages or maintenance.
    - **Failback** occurs when on-prem server is restored.
