- Smaller object to be created in k8s
-  containers run inside pods
- usually have only 1 container inside, but not limited
- sometimes we would need multiple containers within same pod, so the pod can work as a unit as an application
	- ex: a helper which process data
	- Kind of convenient since within the same pod, they share the same volume / network so can access each other through localhost, and the application lifecycle is automatically managed as well
	- still a rare use case
